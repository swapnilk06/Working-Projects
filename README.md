# Watch & Code - Working Projects

- This is my learning journey in public. As I explore and master different technologies—starting with **React JS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and more
- I build and organize projects here. These projects range from small components to full-scale applications.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

This repository is a collection of practical projects that I've created while learning new technologies.

## 🛠️ Current Tech Stack (Starting Point)

I'm currently learning and building using:
- **React.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Vite**
- **Framer Motion**
- (More tools and frameworks will be added as I progress)

## 🧩 How to Run a Project

Each project has its own `README.md` with setup steps. Typically:
```bash
cd path/to/project
npm install
npm run dev
```
